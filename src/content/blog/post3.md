The school bus schedule is a frequently used infographic for students, but the table provided by the school is difficult to read and understand.

Because it is not symmetrical, there are too many colors and useless information. The information was also not grouped by distance or in the same area, nor were the colors similar to the text. Also, the bus stop appearance may be unfamiliar to new students.

>Therefore, I improved the design according to the following principles:
>- Consider the symmetry of the overall picture.
>- Use of proximity to distinguish time by intervals.
>- Use similarity of block color and route color to show readers the difference between the red line and the green line.
>- Design school bus stop icons to make it easy for newcomers to identify stop locations.
