### 視覺設計(Visual Design)- Redesign for the school shuttle bus timetable 

![](https://i.imgur.com/rQKXdI5.png)

The school bus schedule is a frequently used infographic for students, but the table provided by the school is difficult to read and understand.

Because it is not symmetrical, there are too many colors and useless information. The information was also not grouped by distance or in the same area, nor were the colors similar to the text. Also, the bus stop appearance may be unfamiliar to new students.

>Therefore, I improved the design according to the following principles:
>- Consider the symmetry of the overall picture.
>- Use of proximity to distinguish time by intervals.
>- Use similarity of block color and route color to show readers the difference between the red line and the green line.
>- Design school bus stop icons to make it easy for newcomers to identify stop locations.

Community support systems designed to enhance senior living habits.
>Topic:
>
>There are more and more young seniors like Mei in the society. They are at retirement age, they are in good health, their children are independent so they have no financial burden, and they are capable of taking care of themselves in life.
>
>Their focus has been on family, children and work, and they have never had the energy to cultivate their interests... After her husband's passing, Mei feels lonely because of the lack of social interaction, and usually watches TV at home by herself, but she is too shy to go out to make friends.
>
>Please use design methods and theories to help Mei's emotional problems, and encourage her to establish good habits so that she can be outgoing.
